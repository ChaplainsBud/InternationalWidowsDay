                <p>Approxiximately 700,000 women become a widow in the U.S. each year.</p>
                <p>They tend to live 14 years longer: more than a decade.</p>
                <p>This may be 13.6 million in America</p>
                <p>Divorce is the second most stressful event in life; death of a spouse, NUMBER ONE.</p>
                <p>Widows are 66% more likely to die in the next three months, 'widowhood effect.'</p>

                <p>Poverty: 3-4x greater than married peers.</p>
                <p>The median income for women over 65 in America is $17,000</p>
                <p>1/3 of widows are widowed before 60.</p>
                <p>1/3 of those 65 and older are widowed</p>
                <p>Harder for widows to remarry because the pool of single men is smaller than single women.</p>
                <p>Older men with money also prefer younger women, so old widows have a very hard time attracting a spouse.</p>
                <p>To marry a poor, single man her age would compound her poverty.</p>

            <!-- <p>When men give a woman jewelry, nice clothes, a house, car, stocks, bank accounts,
            and so on, they do not merely lift them out of poverty today, but secure their future.
            A future of incredible suffering, for widowhood tends to last 14 years. They protect
            her from molestation, rape, slavery, humiliating and degrading work, malnutrition, a lack 
            of medicine, isolation, depression, anxiety, and fear.</p>
            <p>A man should give sons to his wife so that when she is widowed, she has young men 
                to protect her. He should care for her in such a way that she is able to quickly
                remarry as well, and so escape crushing poverty which is hard for anyone, but 
                especially an elderly woman. The weakest among us, second only to a baby.
