# InternationalWidowsDay

***Never marrying and divorce prevents widowhood. That is, poverty from the start, rather than 
entered into through the loss of a spouse.***

Marriage is primarily about financial security for a woman: The devastation of widowhood signifies
how important it is for her to be married in the first place, to double her income and free her up
to pursue a lucrative career instead of being forced into taking whatever job she can as a poor, 
single parent. Nobody should shame a woman for ignoring her peers in college who have no job,
but waiting for a mature man who has a good foundation and proven track record in accumulating and
maintaining wealth. He must be good at acquisition and management, not a failure to get it or keep it.
After all, this will lead to her suffering both during marriage and in widowhood, if he does not help
her significantly with wealth acquisition/managment before and after he dies.

Beauty is not for consumption; it is not a business transaction. It is loved, protected, 
honored, thanked -- personal. Absolute beauty does not change, and it instantiates itself
in our daughters... who from babies become girls, teens, young adults, middle aged...
widows. We love women because they participate in Absolute Beauty at conception, and
we adorn their graves in memory of who they were... and continue to be. Their soul never
ceases to be beautiful. 

**I do not believe a prostitute is noble; but neither are those who pursue her. It is a socio-economic
situation that should be fixed by the state for public health, both the women and men involved. The
religious/political institutions should supply every widow with housing, food, clothing, medicine, and
education for legitimate occupations. Men who cannot attract a spouse also need help -- they should not
burn with passion and end up in brothels, when a good foundation for a career could help them enter a
relationship with dignity. Schubert could not legally marry in 19th c. Austria due to poverty.**

Poverty. The desperation of not having status in society, where noone favors you because you 
can give nothing of value to them except your body, and that degrades you with mental, physical,
and spiritual illness, as well as long-term poverty -- you can only prostitute your body for 
one's youth. Then it becomes cheaper and cheaper, like the Polcaris Sellers in South Korea. 
Fifteen dollars? There is no period of this wealth for those who are widowed in middle or old age.

a. Shelter: evicted to the streets or shelters, crowded and likely unclean and dangerous.
b. Food: malnourished
c. Clothing: old, shameful, not fitting right, nor protecting from the weather
d. Medicine: unable to secure good treatment, greater pain for the mind and body
e. Transportation: must walk everywhere, use bus, subway... 

This is why the 'woman' becomes tempted to sleep with a wealthy husband: she does not hate
his wife, nor even love the man, but wants shelther, food, and clothing for her children.

She is not filled with lust. She may not go to the strip club, massage parlor, karioke bar,
or red light district in order to get attention -- she is trying to pay for education that 
will get her a real job. Having no husband, nor father, nor uncle, nor brother... she relies
on what she has, and unfortunately this is her body made to bring healthy life into this world.
Now it is an agent of stds, PTSD, aborted fetuses, broken menstral cycles, and... a survival-mode
deceptive mind: how to trick as many men as possible that she cannot live without their body. 
=> what she cannot live without is food for her children. 

The attention a woman is given before and during an adult film is intoxicating. But it can also cause
her to blackout during the actual "intimacy." She likes the provision of a hotel, meals, clothes, 
a makeover, and possibly gifts... but not the actual exploitation. It's care she hungers for, and would
never put herself in this situation if she could find a man who would take care of her without demanding
that she degrade herself -- the way women seem to head when they want to stay in the industry. They cannot
get money if they appear virtuous, like a spouse... but must bear the image of a consumer object. 
=> what she wants is to feel value, and so the mix of value (high income, gifts, and praise)... 
with degradation ... is like bait and switch. They shower her with attention, then use her for their own
pockets. I would imagine the 'stars' make significantly less than the producer and distributor.
